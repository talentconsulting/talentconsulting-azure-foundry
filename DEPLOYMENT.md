# Deployment

The OpenAPI pipeline uses an existing Azure AI Foundry project and five hosted agents. Deploy them in this order:

1. `openapi-source-discovery`
2. `openapi-spec-generator`
3. `openapi-spec-pr-creator`
4. `openapi-spec-workflow`
5. `openapi-manifest-orchestrator` (optional manifest entry point)

## GitHub Actions configuration

Create a GitHub environment named `dev` with these secrets:

| Secret | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | All deployments | Entra application or managed identity client ID for GitHub OIDC. |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | All deployments | Azure tenant ID. |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | All deployments | Azure subscription ID. |
| `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | All deployments | Existing Foundry project endpoint. |

The Azure identity needs deployment access to the Foundry project. The hosted workflow identity needs permission to invoke the other agents in that project.

Create a Foundry Custom keys project connection named `openapi-pr-github` with a write-only `github_token` field. Grant that fine-grained token access only to the destination specification repository, with:

- Metadata: read
- Contents: read and write
- Pull requests: read and write

The PR creator resolves the token from `${{connections.openapi-pr-github.credentials.github_token}}` when its sandbox starts. It is not stored in the agent definition, passed to the orchestration agent, or accepted in an agent request.

The database-schema PR creator reuses `openapi-pr-github`, because it publishes to the same catalogue repository with the same permissions. No second GitHub secret or Foundry connection is required.

### Source-repository read connection

Each `*-source-discovery` agent (`openapi`, `dbschema`, `eventcatalog`, `service-dependency`, `c4`, `local-dev-config`) downloads a GitHub archive of whatever repository `sourceUrl` points at, which can be any repository the pipeline is asked to analyze -- not just the destination catalogue repository. These agents previously reused `openapi-pr-github` for `GITHUB_READ_TOKEN`, but that connection is a fine-grained PAT deliberately scoped to write access on the destination catalogue repository only. Presenting it to an unrelated source repository doesn't fail closed with a clear permissions error -- GitHub returns a plain `404` for a token with no grant on that repository, which is indistinguishable from the repository not existing, even when it's public.

Create a second Foundry Custom keys project connection named `github-source-read` with a `github_token` field holding a token that can read whatever source repositories the pipeline will be pointed at:

- A classic PAT with the `public_repo` scope covers any public repository and raises the rate limit well above the 60 requests/hour anonymous limit.
- If source repositories are private, use a fine-grained PAT with read-only `Contents` and `Metadata` access granted across the relevant organization(s)/repositories instead.

Each `*-source-discovery` agent resolves `GITHUB_READ_TOKEN` from `${{connections.github-source-read.credentials.github_token}}`. `openapi-pr-github` remains scoped to writes on the destination catalogue repository only; nothing in this pipeline should reuse it for reading arbitrary source repositories.

Note: the `*-manifest-orchestrator` agents also read `GITHUB_READ_TOKEN` (currently still `openapi-pr-github`), but only to fetch `manifest.json` from the same destination catalogue repository that token is already scoped to -- that usage is correctly scoped and doesn't need `github-source-read`. However, those orchestrators separately check each manifest entry's *source* repository branch-head commit via the GitHub API using the same token, which has the identical scoping problem described above; that call site is not yet updated to use `github-source-read`.

Optional `dev` environment variables are:

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | `gpt-4o` |
| `AZURE_LOCATION` | `uksouth` |
| `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | `talent-day-rg` |
| `AZURE_AI_ACCOUNT_NAME` | `talent-day-foundry` |
| `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME` | `talent-day-proj-default` |

## Deployment workflows

The following workflows run on changes to their agent on the default branch and support manual dispatch:

- `.github/workflows/deploy-openapi-source-discovery.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-openapi-spec-generator.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-openapi-spec-pr-creator.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-openapi-spec-workflow.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-openapi-manifest-orchestrator.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-dbschema-manifest-orchestrator.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-dbschema-generator.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-dbschema-pr-creator.agent.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-dbschema-workflow.agent.yml`

The PR creator and workflow smoke tests use invalid input deliberately. This verifies the hosted Responses endpoint without writing to a repository during deployment.

## Local deployment

Authenticate Azure CLI and azd, configure each agent project's azd environment with the existing project endpoint, create the `openapi-pr-github` connection, and deploy in dependency order:

```bash
cd agents/hosted/openapi/openapi-spec-pr-creator
azd deploy openapi-spec-pr-creator --no-prompt
```

Then deploy the orchestrator:

```bash
cd ../openapi-spec-workflow
azd deploy openapi-spec-workflow --no-prompt
```

No destination repository is fixed at deployment time. Supply it as `targetRepository` whenever the workflow is invoked.

`openapi-manifest-orchestrator` instead derives its destination from the repository containing its manifest. No routine or schedule is deployed initially; invoke the hosted agent directly while testing.

Deploy the database-schema agents in this order: `dbschema-generator`, `dbschema-pr-creator`, `dbschema-workflow`, then `dbschema-manifest-orchestrator`. Their validation smoke tests do not read GitHub, invoke the model, or change repositories.
