# Local Dev Config Manifest Orchestrator

Reads a shared public GitHub manifest, selects only `local-dev-config` nodes, compares branch-head commits, runs complete deferred local-dev-config workflows, and publishes generated local service and configuration key catalogs plus updated commit hashes in one pull request. A repository whose workflow finds zero local services or configuration keys is a valid, successful outcome. Up to `LOCAL_DEV_CONFIG_MANIFEST_WORKFLOW_CONCURRENCY` workflows (default 4) run at once; results are still processed in manifest order, so the PR content and manifest hashes do not depend on which repository finishes first.
