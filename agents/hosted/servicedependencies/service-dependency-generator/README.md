# Service Dependency Generator

Reads a bounded set of source files chosen by `service-dependency-source-discovery` and returns a validated catalog of containers and their outbound dependencies: HTTP APIs, gRPC services, caches, databases, message brokers, object storage, and other cloud services. It records configuration keys and source evidence but never returns secret values.

The model first identifies `containers`: the independently-deployable projects evidenced in the bundle (an API, a web app, a background job, a message handler). The primary/API container is named after the system itself (never suffixed "Api"); any other container is named `"<system> <role>"` (for example "Commitments Web"). Each kept dependency is a C4-style relationship from the container that evidences it to the dependency: `sourceId` references a container id, `targetId` is a stable slug of the dependency's kind and name (shared across containers that depend on the same thing), and `description` is a deterministic action verb derived from `kind` (for example "Reads from and writes to" for a database, "Calls the API of" for an HTTP API). A dependency's `name` is always its shortest business name -- a leading `I` interface prefix and generic role suffixes such as `Client`, `ApiClient`, `Api`, `Service`, or `Proxy` are stripped even when only one local name is evidenced (`IApprenticeshipLevyApiClient` becomes "Apprenticeship Levy"). The model is also asked to collapse the same real dependency evidenced under different local names (an interface, an implementation class, a friendlier name) into one entry, using that same cleaned name, rather than reporting it more than once.
